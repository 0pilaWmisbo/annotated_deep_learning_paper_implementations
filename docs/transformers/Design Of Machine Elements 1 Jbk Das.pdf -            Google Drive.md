## Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering Design
 
This topic introduces the basic concepts and principles of mechanical engineering design, such as design philosophy, design considerations, engineering materials and their properties, standards and codes, factor of safety and material selection. It also reviews the concepts of stress, strain and deflection in machine elements.
 
## Design for Impact and Fatigue Loads
 
This topic covers the design of machine elements subjected to impact and fatigue loads, such as shafts, gears, springs and fasteners. It explains the theories of failure for static and dynamic loading, such as maximum normal stress theory, maximum shear stress theory, distortion energy theory and Soderberg criterion. It also discusses the concepts of stress concentration, notch sensitivity and endurance limit.
 
## Design of Shafts, Joints, Couplings and Keys
 
This topic covers the design of shafts for rotating machinery, such as turbines, compressors and pumps. It explains the methods of analysis and design of shafts for bending, torsion and combined loading. It also covers the design of joints, couplings and keys for transmitting power and torque between shafts.
 
## Riveted Joints and Weld Joints
 
This topic covers the design of riveted joints and weld joints for connecting plates or beams. It explains the types, advantages and disadvantages of riveted joints and weld joints. It also covers the methods of analysis and design of riveted joints and weld joints for various loading conditions.
