One of the most popular and comprehensive textbooks on biostatistics is *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*, written by Wayne W. Daniel and Chad L. Cross. The book covers topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, regression, correlation, and nonparametric methods. The book also provides examples and exercises using real data from various health sciences disciplines.
 
The latest edition of the book is the 10th edition, published by Wiley in 2013. The 10th edition has been updated to reflect the latest developments and trends in biostatistics, such as the use of R software, Bayesian methods, meta-analysis, and survival analysis. The 10th edition also includes new chapters on logistic regression and longitudinal data analysis.

Here are some additional paragraphs for the article:
 
Biostatistics is not only a theoretical discipline, but also a practical one. Biostatisticians play an important role in designing and conducting health-related studies, such as clinical trials, epidemiological investigations, and genetic analyses. They also help to interpret and communicate the results of these studies to other scientists, policymakers, and the public.
 
Biostatistics is a dynamic and evolving field that adapts to the changing needs and challenges of the health sciences. Some of the current and emerging topics in biostatistics include causal inference, machine learning, big data, bioinformatics, personalized medicine, and spatial statistics. Biostatisticians need to keep up with the latest developments and innovations in these areas and collaborate with other disciplines to solve complex and interdisciplinary problems.
 
Biostatistics is a rewarding and exciting career choice for anyone who is interested in applying mathematics and statistics to improve human health and well-being. Biostatisticians can work in various settings, such as academic institutions, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, health care organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Biostatisticians can also specialize in different areas of health sciences, such as cancer, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, environmental health, and mental health.
