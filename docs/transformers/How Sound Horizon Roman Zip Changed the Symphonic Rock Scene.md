Roman is a concept album that explores the theme of fairy tales and their dark side. The album consists of nine tracks, each telling a different story inspired by a fairy tale or a legend. Some of the stories are based on well-known tales such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Hansel and Gretel, while others are original creations by Revo. The stories are connected by the motif of a mysterious book that contains all the fairy tales in the world.
 
The album features various vocalists and musicians who portray different characters and narrators in the stories. The music ranges from upbeat pop songs to dramatic orchestral pieces, creating a rich and diverse sound horizon for the listeners. The album also includes a bonus track that reveals the origin of the book and its connection to Revo's previous albums.
 
Roman is a masterpiece of musical storytelling that invites the listeners to enter a world of fantasy and horror, where fairy tales are not always what they seem. The album has received critical acclaim and commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies and ranking #3 on the Oricon weekly chart. It has also been adapted into a manga series by Katsura Yura and a live concert by Sound Horizon.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
One of the most distinctive features of Roman is the use of multiple languages and dialects in the lyrics. Revo incorporates English, German, French, Latin, and Japanese in his songs, as well as regional dialects such as Kansai-ben and Hakata-ben. He also creates his own words and phrases based on historical or fictional sources. For example, he uses the term "Romanesque" to refer to the style and atmosphere of the album, which is influenced by the Romanesque art and architecture of medieval Europe.
 
Another notable aspect of Roman is the intertextuality and continuity with Revo's other works. Roman is the first album in the "Sound Horizon Kingdom" series, which consists of seven albums that share a common mythology and timeline. The series spans from the ancient times to the modern era, and features recurring characters and themes. For instance, the bonus track of Roman introduces the character of "Elef", a mysterious girl who appears in several albums and plays a key role in the Sound Horizon Kingdom.
 
Roman is not only a musical album, but also a multimedia project that involves various forms of expression and collaboration. Revo has worked with various artists and creators to expand and enrich the world of Roman. For example, he collaborated with Katsura Yura, a manga artist known for her works such as Trinity Blood and Angel Sanctuary, to create a manga adaptation of Roman that was serialized in Comic ZERO-SUM magazine from 2007 to 2008. He also staged a live concert of Roman in 2008, featuring elaborate costumes, props, and stage effects that brought the stories to life.
