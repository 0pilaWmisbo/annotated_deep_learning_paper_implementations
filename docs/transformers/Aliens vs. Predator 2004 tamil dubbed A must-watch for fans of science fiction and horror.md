## How to create and edit keyframes for your objects
 
Keyframes are the scenes that define the start and end points of your object animations. To create and edit keyframes for your objects, follow these steps:

1. Select the objects that you want to animate. You can select multiple objects by holding down the Shift key and clicking on them.
2. Create a scene for the first keyframe. You can do this by clicking the Add Scene icon ( ) on the Scenes panel. Give your scene a name and click OK.
3. Move, rotate, scale, or reflect your objects to the desired position for the first keyframe. You can use the Move, Rotate, Scale, or Flip Along tools to do this.
4. Click the Record Objects button ( ) on the Keyframe Animation toolbar. This will save the position data of your selected objects on the current scene.
5. Create another scene for the second keyframe. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to position and record your objects for the second keyframe.
6. Continue creating scenes and recording objects until you have all the keyframes you need for your animation.
7. To edit a keyframe, select the scene that corresponds to that keyframe and make any changes to your objects. Then click the Record Objects button again to update the position data.
8. To delete a keyframe, select the scene that corresponds to that keyframe and click the Erase Objects button ( ) on the Keyframe Animation toolbar. This will delete the position data of your selected objects on every scene.

You have now created and edited keyframes for your objects. You can preview your animation by playing your scenes in sequence.
